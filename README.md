======================

The system that you need to build need not be contain any UI​ ​(if you are not too comfortable building one). You solution can just be the APIs. The APIs should include, but not limited to,

✔ 1. Add and retrieve movies to the database
✔ 2. Add and retrieve cast and crew of a movie
✔ 3. Add and retrieve user information
✘ 4. API for a user to rate/recommend  and review a movie
✘ 5. Retrieve recommendations for a user based on the genre and/or cast/crew of his/her previous ratings and recommendations. If the user has no history, generate the recommendation based on the movie ratings in the genre of his/her liking.
✘ 6. Get aggregated ratings of a movie.
✘ 7. Get all the reviews of a movie with pagination.
✘ 8. Upvote/Downvote reviews and comment on reviews.
(Do not bother about authentication)

One of the key things that we would want to see ​is ​the desig​n,​ code quality and implementation decisions that you took to make it extensible and scalable. Also, seems like there is a IMDB API available for you to fetch the movie database. Feel free to use any language/framework of your choice.
